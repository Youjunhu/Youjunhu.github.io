<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >There are a class of numerical methods that make use of the characteristic lines of hyperbolic Partial Diﬀerential Equations
(PDEs). These methods reduce a hyperbolic PDE to a family of ordinary diﬀerential equations that can be
integrated from initial values to get the the solution of the original partial diﬀerential equation. By using the
integration along the characteristic lines, all partial derivatives of the unknown distribution function with respect
to phase-space coordinates are avoided, and thus this method does not need a regular phase-space mesh
to construct numerical approximation to the phase-space partial diﬀerential operators. This enables us to
adopt random sampling of the phase-space, which has the advantage of reducing the error in evaluating
high-dimensional phase-space integration. In this sense, this method can be considered as a kind of “mesh-free”
method.
</p><!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Since the characteristic lines are usually identical to the orbits of particles/elements in the phase-space, these methods
can be generally called “particle methods”. In the core of particle methods, are the method of characteristics and
Monte-Carlo sampling and integration.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   The computational nodes (often called markers/particles/super-particles) in particle methods follow
the particle orbits and thus their positions in phase-space evolve with time, which is one of the diﬀerences
between the particle methods and the usual Euler-grid-based methods that usually uses ﬁxed grid-points.
The evolving computational nodes in particle method are often called Lagrangian markers while the ﬁxed
grids are often called Euler grid-points. Therefore, particle method is a kind of <span 
class="cmbx-10">mesh-free Lagrangian</span>
method.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   The so-called Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method, however, is a kind of <span 
class="cmbx-10">incomplete </span>particle method, in which both evolving
nodes (mesh-free) and ﬁxed grid-points (mesh) are used. Speciﬁcly, the kinetic equation for the particle distribution
function in the phase space is solved by using mesh-free particle methods, whereas Maxwell&#x2019;s eqaution for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld are solved by using spatial mesh. To obtain the source terms in Maxwell&#x2019;s equation at grids, we need
to calculate moments of the distribution function represented by the mesh-free computational nodes. In PIC simulations,
the values of a moment at a spatial grid is approximated by the averaged value of the moment in the corresponding spatial
cell. This averaging procedure, along with the use of ﬁnite spatial shape function of markers (discussed later), has the eﬀect
of reducing (ideally removing) collisions between particles. Collisions, if to be modeled, should be modeled by other
means.

</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   For instance, in solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations by the PIC method, the Vlasov equation for the
phase-space distribution function is solved by using the evolving nodes while the Poisson equation for the
spatial electric potential is solved by using the ﬁxed grid-points. The special nomenclature “particle-in-cell”
refers to the particular way of inferring the value of charge density at the ﬁxed spatial grid-points from the
evolving coordinates of computational markers. Therefore the PIC method is a kind of <span 
class="cmbx-10">hybrid particle-mesh</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">methods</span>.

</p><!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   This note discusses the basic theory of the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation, along with practical implementation in
curvilinear coordinate system. In the process of learning the PIC simulation method, I have developed several toy Fortran
codes to test what I have learned. The numerical results given in these notes are obtained by using these codes. A copy of
these codes can be found at http://theory.ipp.ac.cn/˜yj/codes/pic_1D_src.tar
