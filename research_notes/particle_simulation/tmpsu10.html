<!--l. 773--><p class="noindent" >The overall error of the Monte-Carlo approximation given in Eq. (<a 
href="tmpsu9.html#x13-16004r56">56<!--tex4ht:ref: 17-6-13-3 --></a>) always scales like 1<span

  N &prime;"  class="sqrt"  />, which is
independent of the dimensionality of the phase-space. It is easy to demonstrate that the overall error of the usual
regular-grids approximation to the integration scales like 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">∕N</span><sup><span 
class="cmsy-7">&prime;</span><span 
class="cmr-7">1</span><span 
class="cmmi-7">∕d</span></sup>, where <span 
class="cmmi-10">d </span>is the dimension of the phase
space<span class="cite">[<a 
href="tmpli1.html#XFitzpatrickcp">4</a>]</span>. This fact implies that Monte-Carlo approximation is more accurate than the regular-grids methods for
high-dimension (<span 
class="cmmi-10">d </span><span 
class="msam-10">&ge; </span>3) integration. Due to this reason, particle methods can be considered more accurate than
the Euler-grid-based methods for the same number of sampling points in a high-dimensional (<span 
class="msam-10">&ge; </span>3) phase
space.
</p><!--l. 784--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, PIC simulations obviously contain unphysical noise. The noise is due to the discrete marker eﬀects,
which can be further categorized into two types: sampling noise (ﬂuctuation of the sampling error) and remaining
unwanted collisions in a collisionless simulation.
</p><!--l. 789--><p class="indent" >   Due to the limited small number of markers used in PIC code, there are considerable time and spatial ﬂuctuation over
the the number of markers in a spatial-cell. This ﬂuctuation in the number of sampling points (i.e., ﬂuctuation of the
sampling error) gives rise to the sampling noise.
</p><!--l. 794--><p class="indent" >   Inaccuracy in a PIC simulation is also related to the fact that the phase-space volume sampled by a marker is assumed
to be constant in a PIC code but this assumption is not strictly satisﬁed in practice due to (1) the number of markers being
not large enough and (2) the resulting self-consistent ﬁeld being not smooth enough, which introduce eﬀective collisional
eﬀects, making the conservation of the phase-space volume less accurate. How well the phase-space volume is conserved
depends on the smoothness of the ﬁeld: smooth ﬁeld means less collisions and thus phase-space volume are better
conserved. PIC simulation codes seek to reduce the collision through using ﬁnite-size particles (discussed in Sec. <a 
href="tmpse3.html#x7-80003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: 16-3-29-a5 --></a>) and
averaging in a spatial cell in solving for the electromagnetic ﬁelds, which eﬀectively smooth the ﬁelds. This
kind of PIC simulations are thus designed for collisionless plasmas. And the remaining collisional eﬀect
should be small enough to not aﬀect the process of interest. And this remaining collisional eﬀects should be
viewed as numerical artifacts rather than a modeling of any real collisional eﬀect in plasmas. If we want to
model the real collisional eﬀect in PIC simulation, we need to use other techniques rather than relying on the
remaining collisions mentioned above because the latter is not easy to control and ideally should be completely
removed.
</p><!--l. 814--><p class="indent" >   Various noise reduction techniques in PIC codes (e.g., ﬁnite-size particles, grids, and perturbative <span 
class="cmmi-10">&delta;f </span>method) can be
used when the marker number is ﬁxed. When exhausting all these methods, the ﬁnal brute-force method of reducing noise
(reducing collisions) is to increase the marker number. Therefore the noise issue is ﬁnally a convergence issue about the
marker number.
</p><!--l. 821--><p class="indent" >   From the view of particle simulations, the gyrokinetic model can also be considered as a noise reduction technique,
where the gyro-averaging process makes the ﬁeld on a marker more smooth.
</p><!--l. 825--><p class="indent" >   (Noise in PIC code is equivalent to the remaining artiﬁcial collision eﬀect? We can test this by doing a test particle
simulation, in which we loaded a group of markers to sample a distribution function in the phase space and then compute
the density evolution of the sampled distribution under a given smooth electromagnetic ﬁeld (i.e., eliminating the
collisional eﬀect). If there is still signiﬁcant noise in the time evolution, then this indicates there are factors other
than collisions that contribute to the noise. I did this when I studied Landau damping, the results indicate
there is still signiﬁcant noise in the solution, indicating the discrete phase space sampling is the root of the
noise.)
</p><!--l. 836--><p class="indent" >   One thing to note is that the noisy results obtained in particle method are not necessarily less accurate than the smooth
results obtained in Euler-grid-based methods because bigger errors may be hidden in smooth results when one uses coarse
grids.
