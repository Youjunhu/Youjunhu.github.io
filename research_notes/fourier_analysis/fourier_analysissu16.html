<!--l. 961--><p class="noindent" >Signals that are not band-limited usually contains all frequencies and thus do not
satisfy the condition required by the sampling theorem (i.e., <span

class="cmmi-10">f</span>) = 0 for
<span

class="cmmi-10">N </span>data, we can still calculate its DFT by
using Eq. (<a 
href="fourier_analysissu4.html#x8-7001r34">34<!--tex4ht:ref: 2-26-2 --></a>). However the results obtained are meaningful only when <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">n</span></sub>
approaches zero as the frequency approaches <span 
class="cmsy-10">−</span>1<span 
class="cmmi-10">∕</span>(2Δ) from above and approaches
1<span 
class="cmmi-10">∕</span>(2Δ) from below, i.e., only when the results obtained are consistent with the
assumption used to obtain the results (the assumption is that <span 
class="cmmi-10">H</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10">f</span>) = 0 for

class="cmmi-10">∕</span>(2Δ)). When the results obtained do not satisfy the above condition, then it
indicates that the “aliasing errors” have contributed to the results. We can reduce
the aliasing errors by increasing the sampling frequency. The aliasing errors
can be reduced but can not be completely removed for a non-band-limited
signal.
</p><!--l. 975--><p class="indent" >   In signal processing and related disciplines, <span 
class="cmbx-10">aliasing</span> is an eﬀect that causes
diﬀerent signals to become indistinguishable (or <span 
class="cmti-10">aliases</span> of one another) when
sampled. It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a
signal reconstructed from samples is diﬀerent from the original continuous
signal.
</p><!--l. 981--><p class="indent" >   An alias is a false lower frequency component that appears in sampled data
acquired at too low a sampling rate.
</p><!--l. 984--><p class="indent" >   Aliasing errors are hard to detect and almost impossible to remove using software.
The solution is to use a high enough sampling rate, or if this is not possible, to use an
anti-aliasing ﬁlter in front of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to eliminate
the high frequency components before they get into the data acquisition
system.
</p><!--l. 990--><p class="indent" >   When a digital image is viewed, a reconstruction is performed by a display or
printer device, and by the eyes and the brain. If the image data is processed in some
way during sampling or reconstruction, the reconstructed image will diﬀer from the
original image, and an alias is seen.
</p><!--l. 995--><p class="indent" >    
</p><!--l. 997--><p class="indent" >   Aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage;
these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing (<span 
class="cmti-10">prealiasing</span>) and
reconstruction aliasing (<span 
class="cmti-10">postaliasing</span>).
</p><!--l. 1002--><p class="indent" >   In video or cinematography, temporal aliasing results from the limited frame rate,
and causes the <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect" >wagon-wheel eﬀect</a>, whereby a spoked wheel appears to rotate too
slowly or even backwards. Aliasing has changed its apparent frequency of rotation. A
reversal of direction can be described as a <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_frequency" >negative frequency</a>. Temporal aliasing
frequencies in video and cinematography are determined by the frame rate of the
                                                                  

                                                                  
camera, but the relative intensity of the aliased frequencies is determined by the
shutter timing (exposure time) or the use of a temporal aliasing reduction ﬁlter
during ﬁlming.
