<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >This note was written when I was developing numerical codes that need to use
FFT libraries. Fourier series and Fourier transform are usually taught in
undergraduate calculus courses. To numerically use this mathematical method
in practice, one additional necessary step is to know the Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT). There are many online material discussing these topics and I
read some of them. But ﬁnally I found that I need to derive all the relevant
formulas step by step by myself. This note gives step by step derivation of the
deﬁnition of DFT and its variations such as the discrete sine transform. I also
discuss how relate this to the output of various FFT computer libraries (e.g.
FFTW).
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   The Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) makes the Fourier analysis fast
enough to solve many real-life problems, which makes FFT be among the top ten
algorithms that have changed the world. The FFT algorithm remained mysterious to
me for many years until I read Cooley and Tukey’s original paper, which turns out to
be a very concise paper and very easy to follow (details are discussed in Append.
