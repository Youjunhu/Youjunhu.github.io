<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >These notes were written when I was developing numerical codes that need to use
FFT libraries. Like all physics majors, I learned the Fourier series and Fourier
transform in calculus courses when I was a undergraduate student. To apply this
important mathematical method in practice, one additional necessary step
is to know the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its fast numerical
implementation, i.e., Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT). There are many
online material discussing these topics and I read some of them. But ﬁnally I found
that I need to derive all the relevant formulas step by step by myself to
convince myself that I fully understand the DFT and its many variations,
such as discrete sine transform, and I am correctly using the output of FFT
libraries.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Although the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm (FFT) is among the top
ten algorithms that have changed the world, we do not need to know the
details about this algorithm itself, which is essentially an eﬃcient way of
computing the summation involved in the DFT. What we need to know is how
the DFT is deﬁned (so that we know how it can be used) and how it is
related to the output of the various subroutines in various FFT computer
libraries (e.g. FFTW). This is the emphasis of these notes, which give step by
step derivation of the deﬁnition of DFT and its variation, the discrete sine
transform.
