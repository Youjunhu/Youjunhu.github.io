<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >It is widely believed that low-frequency (lower than ion cyclotron frequency) electromagnetic
perturbations are more important than high-frequency ones in transporting plasma in tokamaks, based
on some non-conclusive observations and analytical theories. (This assumption can be veriﬁed
numerically when we are able to do a full simulation including both low-frequency and high-frequency
perturbations. This kind of veriﬁcation is not possible at present due to the diﬃculties in doing a full
simulation.)
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   If only the low-frequency perturbations are present, the original Vlasov equation can be simpliﬁed.
Speciﬁcally, some kind of symmetry of the perturbed particle distribution function in the phase
space can be established if we choose suitable coordinates (independent variables) for the
phase space and split the distribution function in a proper way. The symmetry is along
the so-called gyro-angle <span 
class="cmmi-10">α </span>in the guiding-center coordinates (<span 
class="cmbx-10">X</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">,v</span><sub><span 
class="cmsy-7">⊥</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">,v</span><sub><span 
class="cmsy-7">∥</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">,α</span>). In obtaining
the equation for the gyro-angle independent part of the distribution function, we need to
                                                                                

                                                                                
average the coeﬃcients of the equation over the gyro-angle <span 
class="cmmi-10">α </span>and thus this model is called
“gyrokinetic”.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   In deriving the gyrokinetic equation, the perturbed electromagnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be known
and of low-frequency. To do a kinetic simulation, we need to solve the ﬁeld equation to obtain the
perturbed electromagnetic ﬁeld. High frequency modes (e.g., compressional Alfven waves and <span 
class="cmmi-10">Ω</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">H</span></sub>
modes) can still appear in a gyrokinetic simulation. If the amplitude of high frequency modes is
large, then the simulation is not meaningful since the gyrokinetic model is invalid in this
case.
