The files in this directory are my research notes.
They provide a backup for the files on my laptop computer.
Some of the notes are reviews of specific papers or books;
some of them are my own derivation/proof of some formulas; 
some of them are the summary of the results of my recent work.
Most of the notes are incomplete in the present status and may be not understandable to others.
I'll update the notes when I make changes to the notes on my laptop computer.
