<h1>Free softwares I use</h1>
<!--I respect my freedom to modify and improve the software I use, so I use only softewares that respect users' freedom to do theses things. Now the only software satisfying this kind of requirement is the open source software developed by the free software communities.-->
<p>"Free software refers to software that ensures that the end users have the freedom of studying and modifying that software. The issue is therefore not about price, but about the freedoms of the end users; e.g. free software guarantees these freedom-rights by providing source codes to the end users."</p>
<p>As a computational physicist, I prefer to use free softwares because they usually provides better customization to make me work efficiently.
Using free software instead of proprietary one is a trend in computational physics community.
</p>
<p>I have been a GNU/Linux user since 2007. This page lists the free softwares I use frequently. These softwares are all open source softwares, most of which are very popular in open-source communities. </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU operating system</a></h2>
<p>GNU is a Unix-like operating system. For me, GNU/Linux operating system provides a stable, flexible, and highly customizable working platform.</p>
<!--<p> Nowadays, free operating systems, e.g. GNU/Linux, are getting more and more popular. Although MS windows operating system still dominates in the scientific community, the situation may change in the near future (within 10 years in my opinion).</p>-->

<h2><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a></h2>
<p>Gnuplot is command-line driven graphing utility. Most of the figures in my publications are created by gnuplot. The gnuplot terminals I frequently use are x11, postscript, epslatex, png, and gif.</p>
<p>Gnuplot can generate animation by using the "gif" terminal. The following are three examples, which describe, respectively, (1) <a href="http://theory.ipp.ac.cn/~yj/figures/traveling_wave.plt">a traveling wave</a>, (2) <a href="figures/standing_wave.plt">a standing wave </a>that forms due to two traveling waves with the same frequency and aptitude but opposite directions of propagation, and (3) <a href="http://theory.ipp.ac.cn/~yj/figures/two_wave_packages.plt">two interacting wave packages</a></p>
<p><img  src="figures/traveling_wave.gif" alt="wave" width="400" /> <img  src="figures/standing_wave.gif" alt="wave" width="400" /> <img  src="figures/two_wave_packages.gif" alt="wave" width="400"/> </p>
<p>The following is a 2D animation describing m=4 ballooning modes in tokamak (right figure is for a mode with radial phase variation):</p>
<p><img  src="figures/ballooning_modes.gif" alt="ballooning modes" width="400" /> <img  src="figures/ballooning_modes2.gif" alt="ballooning modes" width="400" /> </p>
<p><img  src="figures/AE1.gif" alt="ballooning modes" width="800" /> <img  src="figures/AE2.gif" alt="ballooning modes" width="800" /> </p>
<p>The following is an 3D animation of a guiding center orbit in EAST tokamak:</p>
<p><img  src="figures/orbit_3d.gif" alt="orbit 3D" width="500" /> </p>
<p> Another 3D animation of guiding center orbit with the corresponding banana orbit on the poloidal plane (10keV Deuterium ion with pitch angle 80 degree starting from (R=2.1m,Z=0) in EAST#38300@3.9 magnetic equilibrium):</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.texmacs.org">TeXmacs</a></h2>
<p>I rely heavily on Texmacs to write <a href="./research_notes/" >notes containing mathematical formulas</a>. In recent years, I seldom use paper and pencil for deriving mathematical formulas, all these are done in Texmacs. Texmacs is a free wysiwyw (what you see is what you want) format editor with special features for scientists. If you are still writing obscure TEX codes to prepare papers for publication, and want to know what is the right way to prepare papers without MS word, I recommend you to try Texmacs.</p>
<p>I also use Texmacs as an interface to <a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">Maxima</a> (a famous computer algebra system in free software communities). Here is a screenshot of my using Maxima in Texmacs:</p>
<img  src="figures/texmacs_maxima_screenshot.jpg"  width="800" /> 

<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a></h2>
<p>Emacs can be called "the king of text editors". I use it to write various codes, misc notes, and, of course, this web page.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a></h2>
<p>Bash is the default command-line interpreter for most Linux distributions. While the most frequent use of bash is to provide a command line to execute commands, the most powerful ability of bash is its use as a script language, which makes most of my routine works in Linux automatic and error-free.</p>
<!--<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell">csh</a></h2>
<p>Another command-line interpreter. I prefer csh to bash because the overall style of csh looks more like C and is more readable to me.</p>-->
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a></h2>
<p>I use "GNU make" to control the compiling process of Fortran codes written by me.</p>
<h2><a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a></h2>
<p>I use rsync to synchronize the content of several directories between my laptop, desktop computer, and the cluster.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.latex2html.org/">Latex2html</a></h2>
<p> I use latex2html to transform latex files (which themselves are exported from texmacs format) to html format. The <a href="./research_notes/tokamak_equilibrium/">html version of my research notes</a> are obtained this way.</p>

<h2>Vector graphics drawing softwares:  <a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a>, <a href="http://xfig.org/">Xfig</a>, <a href="http://www.tug.org/metapost.html">Metapost</a></h2>
<p>In science, we prefer vector graphics over raster graphics (also called bitmap). The reason is that the former uses paths, points, lines, curves and shapes or polygons (which are all based upon mathematical equations) to represent images, which makes the images generated can be scaled without degrading the clarity of the images (raster graphics represent images as an array of pixlels and thus scale with loss of clarity).</p>
<p>Xfig is a vector graphics editor I have once used. Xfig is easy to use and is enough for drawing simple technical vector graphics. The following is a vector graphic created by Xfig, describing the nuetral beam injection geometry on EAST tokamak.
<p><img  src="figures/nbi_east.png" alt="NBI_east" width="300"/></p>
There is  no further development of Xfig in recent years. Now I have switched to a much more advanced vector graphic editors, " <a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a>,". </p>
<p>Metapost is a vector graphic programming language that can be used to produce high-quality graphics. I use it to draw sketch map used in my papers and presentation to make things clear. A figure used in my Ph.D. thesis is as follows:</p>
<p><img  src="figures/scheme.gif" alt="scheme" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/">sed</a></h2>
<p>Sed is a stream editor, which is usually invoked in shell scripts to transform text files. I use sed to transform texmacs source files when I need to do some final revisons to make them compatible with some texmacs-latex convertors. I also use sed to alter parameters in input namelist files of fortran programs. Doing this way makes the process of parameter scan automatic, thus making the process of parameter scan error-free</p>  
<h2><a href="http://www.fvwm.org/">FVWM</a></h2>
<p>FVWM is a window manager for X window system, which is simple and at the same time highly configurable.
I prefer X window system plus FVWM as my desktop environment rather than the heavy desktop environment such as Gnome and KDE, though they are excellent and work well for most people. <a href="my_screenshot.jpg">This</a> is the screen shot of my desktop. My FVWM configure file can be found <a href="my_fvwm_config">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evince/">Evince</a></h2>
<p>Evince is a viewer for multiple document formats, including PDF, djvu, and Postscript. It seems Evince lacks some important features such as shortcuts for going forward and backward. Occasionally, I use "adobe PDF reader for Linux"</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gv/">gv</a></h2>
<p>I use gv to view eps figure created by gnuplot.</p>
<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer">mplayer</a></h2>
<p>Mplayer is an excellent video and audio player. Mplayer can play video even when you do not start the X window system. I use the following command to play randomly the music files in my ~/music directory:</p>
<pre>cd ~/music/ &amp;&amp; mplayer `ls |sort --random-sort`</pre>
We can also use the -shuffle option along with the find command to play randomly all the mp3 files on the system:
<pre>find -iname '*.mp3' >mylist && mplayer  -shuffle -playlist mylist</pre>


<h2>Firefox</h2>
<p>Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser, which is one of the most popular open source softwares</p>
<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></h2>
<p> Wikipedia in English is a good and free source of knowledge. It is convenient to edit the content of wikipedia. I have been a contributor of wikipedia since 2007. Although I usually make minor revision to wikipedia, I am happy to know that I contribute to the improvement of the content of wikipedia. </p>
<!--<p>By the way, I had denoted 5 Chinese yuan to Wikipedia foundation.</p>-->
<h2>rxvt-unicode</h2>
<p>An X11 terminal supporting Chinese.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/wget/">GNU wget</a></h2>
<p>GNU Wget is a utility for downloading files from the Web. A useful function of Wget is the so-called "recursive downloading", which follows links in webpages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully mirroring the directory structure of the original site. For example, I use the following command line to download all the lecture notes on Electromagnetism at Prof. Fitzpatrick's website:</p>
<pre>wget -r -l 2 -p http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/jk1/Electromagnetism/index.html</pre>
<h2><a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a></h2>
<p>a program for logging into and/or executing commands on a remote machine. Openssh encrypts all traffic to effectively eliminate connection hijacking and other attacks. In China, this encrypting feature, along with the port forwarding capability, provides one way to visit some websites outside China.
</p>
<h2>Claws Mail</h2>
<p>A simple email client. Though I have used it for several years, I do not like it.</p>
<h2>Stardict</h2>
<p>A dictionary software I use. However, I do not think it is an excellent dictionary software.</p>
<h2>Chinese input method: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fcitx">fcitx</a></h2>
<p>I switch to using fctix after using the scim input method for 8 years (since 2007).</p>

<h2><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/">gfortran</a></h2>
<p> Gfortran (GNU Fortran compiler) is my primary Fortran compiler.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">Lapack</a></h2>
<p>LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) is a robust library for numerical linear algebra. All linear algebra related works in numerical codes written by me are done by calling the corresponding Lapack subroutines.</p>
<h2>rox-filer</h2>
<p>a file manager, seldom used </p>
<h2>gthumb</h2>
<p>Gthumb is an image viewer and organizer</p>
<h2>gimp</h2>
<p>The GNU Image Manipulation Program for X Window systems.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick suite  of tools</a></h2>
<p>ImageMagick provides a suit of command-line utilities, such as convert and import, which can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. 
</p>
<h2>Various command-line utilities</h2>
<p>Various command-line utilities that can be used to finish various tasks: grep, paste, ps, jobs, kill, top, du, find, ls, cd, cp, scp, mv, mkdir, cat, rm, tar, chmod, apptitude, sudo, sort, wc, diff, patch, man, pdftk, epsmerge,epstool, lftp, ...</p>
<p>The following one-line awk script</p>
<pre>history | awk '{CMD[$2]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] " " CMD[a]/count*100 "% " a;}' | grep -v "./" | column -c3 -s " " -t | sort -nr | nl |  head -n10</pre>
<p>gives the top 10 commands invoked from my terminal:</p>
<pre>
     1	3244  16.22%   ls
     2	3222  16.11%   cd
     3	2357  11.785%  gnuplot
