<p>The phenomenon of numerical thermalization in the standard particle-in-cell(PIC) simulation of Vlasov plasmas has been extensively studied at the early stage of its development and was considered well understood. However, it was recently reported that the well-established scaling law for the thermalization time could be compromised by the presence of an additional stochastic force acting on the particles, which is used to simulate collisional processes in a weakly ionized gas. In the present work, we are interested in the problem of electron-ion collisions in a fully ionized plasma. We investigate the thermal relaxation phenomenon in the PIC simulation of a Lorentz plasma in one dimension. The pitch-angle scattering of the electrons by the stationary ion background is modeled by a Monte-Carlo algorithm. The numerical results obtained indicate that the thermal relaxation time is proportional to N<sub>D</sub> (the number of particles per Debye length), and not N<sub>D</sub><sup>2</sup> as in the standard PIC simulations. Our results appear to complement those found by the previous study.</p>
