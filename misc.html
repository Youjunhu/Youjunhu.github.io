<h1> <a href="./fortran/fortran.html">Notes on Fortran</a></h1>
<p>As a computational physicist using Fortran for nearly 20 years (since 2000), I summarize <a href="./misc/fortran.html">what I know about Fortran and what features are most often used in practical programming</a>.</p>

<h1> <a href="./misc/python.html">Notes on Python</a></h1>
<p>Python is a popular programming language, which is now so popular that every scientist needs to know a little bit of Python, just like that a scientist needs to know English. Here is <a href="./misc/python.html">my note on Python</a></p>

<h1> Notes on Lisp/Scheme</h1>
<p>Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language (behind Fortran). Richard Stallman stated in one of his articles: “The most powerful programming language is Lisp. If you don't know Lisp (or its variant, Scheme), you don't know what it means for a programming language to be powerful and elegant. Once you learn Lisp, you will see what is lacking in most other languages.” I am curious about this, which motivated me to begin to learn a little bit of Lisp in September of 2015. <a href="misc/Lisp.pdf">Here are my notes on Lisp</a></p>


<h1>HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript</h1>
<p>
When I worked at University of Colorado Boulder, my office is on the same floor of <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">Physics Education interactive simulation group</a>. This group develops interactive educational tools for high school students and teachers. They primarily use HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript so that their tools can be widely accessible. John and Chris are developers in this group. We often talk about HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript, which reminds me to learn a little bit about programming in JavaScript.</p>

        <strong>Fig. </strong> Sun-Earth-Moon system animation using HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript. [source code for producing this animation: <a href="scripts/main.js">main.js</a>] In the animation, the ratio of the Moon orbital period to Earth orbital period is 1:12, which is close to <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question32.html"> the correct value</a>. The ratio of the Moon radius to the Earth radius is also close to the correct value, i.e., 0.27. Taking the Earth size shown in the animation as a reference, the distance between the Moon and Earth is decreased by a factor of 30. The size of the Sun and the distance between the Sun and Earth are reduced by a factor of 50 and 5000, respectively. </p>

<p> This is my daughter's favorite game when she was 5 years old. It supports local Multiplayer mode and this is one of the reasons that she loves this game because we can play together and it's fun </p>
